I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. 

Really passionate about technology, computer vision, machine and deep learning engineer. I'm working hard in cloud and AI worlds. Always open to knowledge, to learn, observe, reflect and then to take the best of myself and share it with others. I'm thrilled by the idea of ownership, passionate about creating new AI platforms, features and services from scratch, and thinking about to one day manage the ambiguity and pace of a company shipping software in cycles measured not by years, but by weeks.

Lover of AI DevOps and make our intelligent models the capability to deploy everywhere with IoT devices and so interested every time to listen everybody, teachers, developers, geeks, or people who simply are interesting and creative, don't doubt to contact me!
